        <h2>The History of Land Art</h2>
        <p>The genre of land art emerged from several factors.
            One of them was an increasing discontent with commercialized art, leading to an interest in artforms that wouldn't be restricted to the confines of a gallery.
            The emerging ecological movements of the time also led to a fascination with the outside world.
            These two factors, along with coinciding art movements such as Conceptual Art, led to the land art genre forming.
            The genre manifested in many forms, from elaborate carvings into the landscape to leaving canvases outside to be stained by the environment.
            The peak era of land art was in the 1970s, and faltered due to the economic downturn in that decade making it harder to obtain funds for the often-elaborate artworks.

        <h3>Ancient Land Art?</h3>
        <p>While the modern genre of land art emerged in the 1960s, it seems like these works mirrored a far more ancient time.
            Many of the most famous of ancient structures often have similarities in structure to modern land art.
            Examples include the arranged boulders of Stonehenge, and the elaborately carved giant figures of the Nazca lines.
            Given the general fascination with nature inherent in the land art genre, it wouldn't be surprising if it also hand some inspiration from ancient societies percived as being "closer to the earth".
