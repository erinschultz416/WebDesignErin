        <h2>What is Land Art?</h2>
        <p>The Land Art Movement, also known as Earth Art or Earthworks, emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a significant departure from traditional art practices. 
            It was characterized by artists creating large-scale, site-specific installations in natural landscapes using the earth itself as their primary medium. 
            Prominent figures in this movement, such as Robert Smithson, Nancy Holt, and Michael Heizer, sought to break away from the confines of traditional art spaces, like galleries and museums, and engage directly with the environment. 
            Their works often featured massive sculptures, geometric patterns, or alterations to the natural terrain, blurring the lines between art and the natural world. 
            Land artists aimed to provoke a new perspective on the environment, encouraging viewers to consider the relationship between humanity and nature, the passage of time, and the transient nature of their creations. 
            The Land Art Movement remains influential today, reminding us of the profound connection between art and the planet on which we live.</p>

        <h3>Spiral Jetty</h3>
        <p>Constructed in 1970 by Robert Smithson, the Spiral Jetty is one of the most famous works of land art, and can be seen in the header of this website.
            It consists of a large spiral constructed from mud and rocks one the northeastern short of the Great Salt Lake.
            Constructing the work required Smithson to hire several contractors to help move the large amounts of rocks involved, and took about a week to complete.
            The construction was recorded and compiled into a 32-minute film (which has the same name as the artwork).
            The structure became submerged in water for several decades, until droughts in the early 2000s revealed the sculpture again.
            Currently owned by the Dia Art Foundation, the Spiral Jetty remains a fairly popular tourist destination.
