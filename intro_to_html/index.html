<p>Budgies are a common bird in the pet trade. 
    Pet budgies have a larger average size than their wild kin.
In captivity, budgies are known to mimic human speech and other sounds.
They usually live 5-8 years in captivity, but longer lifespans have been recorded.</p>

<h3>Color Morphs</h3>
<p>Domestic Budgies have had multiple color mutations bred into their lineage. A more complete list can be seen <a href="https://puppiesareprozac.com/budgie-parakeet/colors-varieties-mutations-genetics/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>Green: The wild coloration, a bright green with a yellow head and blue cheek patches.</li>
    <li>Blue: A light blue body with a white head. Minor marking colors remain the same.</li>
    <li>Dilute: A mutation effecting several varieties, resulting in green muting to yellow and blue muting to white.</li>
    <li>Cinnamon: A mutation that effects the black markings on a budgie, making them a dark brown color.</li>
</ul>
